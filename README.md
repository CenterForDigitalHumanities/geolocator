# RERUM Geolocator
Thank you for you interest in the RERUM Geolocator by the Research Computing Group at Saint Louis University.  Here you can bring your own resource and generate Geolocating Web Annotations to place them on a web map.  You can also add a `navPlace` property to [IIIF Defined Types](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#21-defined-types) and import them into [RERUM](httos://rerum.io), which will make them viewable in the [Navplace Viewer](https://map.rerum.io).

## üåüüëç Contributors üëçüåü
To contribute (you will want to run this on localhost), read the [RERUM Geolocator Contributors Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).  You will need to contact the site admins for the token information.  If you are looking to fork and run your own geolocator, continue reading.

## Installation
The geolocator is a NodeJS app.  It can run through a standard GitHub Pages set up for a NodeJS app.

You will need to add the following GitHub Secrets:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN =
REFRESH_TOKEN =
RERUM_REGISTRATION_URL = https://store.rerum.io/v1/
RERUM_API_ADDR = https://store.rerum.io/v1/api/
RERUM_ID_PATTERN = https://store.rerum.io/v1/id/
RERUM_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL = https://store.rerum.io/v1/client/request-new-access-token
PORT = 3005
```

You can obtain an `ACCESS_TOKEN` and a `REFRESH_TOKEN` by signing up with RERUM at https://store.rerum.io/v1/.  The access token will attribute the data your app creates to your specific version, noting the data as separate from the data created by https://geo.rerum.io.

Your geolocator will attempt to run on port `3005`.  If port `3005` is taken, then update the .env value `PORT` to an open port and try to start it again.

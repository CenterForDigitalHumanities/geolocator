# Contribute to the RERUM Geolocator

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank You

Thank you for considering a contribution to this application! The `main` branch is protected and you cannot push it.

## Developers

## Installation

You will need NodeJs and Git installed on your machine:
[NodeJS Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download)- Npm allows you to run geolocator on your localhost
[Git Installaition Guide](https://desktop.github.com)- Use git to commit any changes you want to make to the geolocator github

Then use the following git shell for installing the app on your local machine.

```
cd /code_folder
git clone https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/geolocator.git geolocator
npm install
```
 **Note: do not run** `npm audit fix`. We will do that upstream in the `main` branch

 ## Secret Token

 If you want to contribute, it is imortant you are able to deploy the code and run tests locally.  To do so, you will need to create a `.env` file which contains secrets. Once you have the secrets, you can continue.

 Contact the developers for the required development secrets!

Create a file named `.env` in the root folder.  In the above example, the root is `/code_folder/geolocator`.  `/code_folder/geolocator/.env` looks like this:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN = OBTAINED_FROM_ADMINS
REFRESH_TOKEN = OBTAINED_FROM_ADMINS
RERUM_REGISTRATION_URL = https://devstore.rerum.io/v1/
RERUM_API_ADDR = https://devstore.rerum.io/v1/api/
RERUM_ID_PATTERN = https://devstore.rerum.io/v1/id/
RERUM_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL = https://devstore.rerum.io/v1/client/request-new-access-token
PORT = 3005
```

**Note: do not commit .env file when trying to push into main branch**

## Run it

Now, you can run tests
`npm run runtest`

And start the app
`npm start`

Your geolocator will attempt to run at `http://localhost:3005`.  If port `3005` is taken, then update the .env value `PORT` to an open port and try to start it again.

To stop the service, kill or exit the process via your shell (CTRL + c or CTRL + x).

## üéâ Ready to Start Contributing!

Excellent, way to get there!  Now find an issue you want to work on and create a new branch through the GitHub Interface or through your shell.  Make sure you 'checkout' that branch.

```
cd /code_folder/geolocator
git checkout my_new_branch
```
Now you can make code changes and see them in real time by using npm start. When you are finished with your changes add you file to and commit your changes.

```
git add file
git commit -a -m "Adding file"
git push
```

Once you have pushed your changes, open a Pull Request that targets the main branch at [Geolocator Main](https://github.com/CenterFor DigitalHumanitites/geolocator/tree/main/).
